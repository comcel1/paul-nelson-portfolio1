    <div class="about-text">
      <p>
        Paul grew up in a musical family, beginning piano lessons at age 5 and cello lessons at age 9. He came to
        Nashville after being awarded the top music scholarships at Belmont University. 8 months prior to graduation,
        Paul was offered a full-time position on coveted Music Row, working for Word Music. During his time at Word,
        Paul was able to hone his skills as a producer and music executive. It was here that Paul learned that he is
        truly a “left-brained creative,” discovering a passion for the intersection of music and commerce.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, Paul has maintained an active freelance career, filling a myriad of roles across the music
        industry including performing, arranging, production, project management and much more. As a result of his
        breadth of knowledge, tech startups such as Jammber, have engaged him as a consultant as they work to modernize
        the music industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        The culmination of his professional experience has led him to be a contractor and trusted leader, especially
        during the pandemic. Paul says, “The job of a contractor is to be a liaison between the client and the players.
        The client needs to know that they are getting the best product at the agreed upon rate, and the players need to
        know that the contractor will watch out for them.” This philosophy has served him well as he has performed and
        contracted musicians for heavyweight artists such as Miley Cyrus, Shania Twain, OneRepublic, the Jonas Brothers,
        Dua Lipa, U2, Paul McCartney, and many others.
